  HARDWARE PIXEL: A physical pixel on the display (or the lightbulbs that go on an off on the screen). For example, an iPhone 5 has a screen with 640 horizontal hardware pixels.

  DEVICE-INDEPENDENT PIXEL (dip): A scaling of device pixels to match a uniform reference pixel at normal viewing distance, which should be approximately the same size on all devices. An iPhone 5 is 320dips wide.

  CSS PIXEL: The unit used for page layout controlled by the viewport. Pixel dimensions in styles such as 'width: 100px' are specified in CSS Pixels. The ratio of CSS pixels to device independent pixels is the page scale factor, or zoom (see <meta name="viewport"> tag attribute 'content=initial-scale=1.0').

  The difference between dips and hardware pixels define the pixel density of the device. For every dip in the iPhone 5, there are 2 hardware pixels. This results in a sharper display definition. This is what Retina Displays are all about (higher pixel densities).
